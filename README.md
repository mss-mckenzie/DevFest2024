Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

They produce a wide variety of boards for a wide variety of needs. We will be using the Arduino nano. This is an inexpensive board that is perfect for small projects.

## L298N Pinout

The L298N is also called an H-Bridge. It is used for 2 reasons.
1. It allows us to direct voltage that is higher than our board can handle. We need this if we can our car to move with any speed at all.
2. It allows us to reverse to polarity on our votage. This allows us to spin the motors in the other direction.
